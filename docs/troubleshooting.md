## Low real-time factor on Gazebo

If your machine has two GPUs (or a CPU with an integrated GPU), OpenGL may be using the *integrated* GPU for rendering, which causes RTF to be very low. To fix this, you may need to manually force it to use the *discrete* GPU.

To check if Open GL is using the discrete GPU, run `glxinfo -B`. The output should show the details of your discrete GPU. Additionally, you can verify GPU-specific process by running `nvidia-smi`. When the AIC sim is active, `gz sim` should appear in the process list.

If the wrong GPU is selected, run `sudo prime-select nvidia`.
**Note**: You must log out and log in again for the changes to take effect. Then, re-run `glxinfo -B` to verify that the discrete GPU is active.
